# LoRa-Jamming-Dataset

The dataset consists of 31919 labeled samples of LoRaWAN network under jamming. The jamming period is from 2/8/23 2:16 PM to 2/8/23 4:59 PM.
This data was used to calculate Packet Loss Ratio for a LoRaWAN testbed under acttack from a reactive Jammer. An LSTM autoencoder model was then trained to detect the presence of Jamming.
